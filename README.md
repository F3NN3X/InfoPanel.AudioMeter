- 🏷️ **Device Information** - Shows friendly names, device names, and device identification
- 🔌 **InfoPanel Integration** - Works with InfoPanel's plugin architecture and multi-container support
- 🛠️ **Windows API Integration** - Uses Windows Core Audio API via P/Invoke for reliable performance
- 💾 **Memory Management** - Proper COM object lifecycle management with disposal patterns
- 🔍 **Logging** - Serilog integration for diagnostics and monitoring

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [InfoPanel](https://github.com/InfoPanel-Project/InfoPanel) application
- Windows operating system (Windows Core Audio API required)
- .NET 8.0 Runtime (Windows-specific version)

### Plugin Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](../../releases) page
2. Extract the plugin files to your InfoPanel plugins directory:
   ```
   InfoPanel/plugins/InfoPanel.AudioMeter/
   ├── InfoPanel.AudioMeter.dll
   └── PluginInfo.ini
   ```
3. Restart InfoPanel to load the plugin

> **Note**: No external dependencies required. The plugin uses direct Windows Core Audio API integration via P/Invoke.

## Usage

Once installed, the Audio Meter plugin will appear in InfoPanel's sensor list with multiple containers:

- **Default Audio Meter** - Tracks the Windows default audio device with automatic switching
  - Device name and audio level (0-100% with responsive scaling)
- **Audio Meter - [Device Name]** - Individual containers for each available audio device
  - Device friendly name, device name, and real-time audio level with VU meter behavior
- **Update Rate**: 20 FPS (50ms intervals) for smooth metering

### VU Meter Behavior

The plugin features responsive scaling curves designed for realistic music monitoring:

- **Typical Music Content**: Raw audio signals around 0.25-0.4 (normal loud music) display as 90-99% on the meters
- **Full Volume Music**: Music at 100% system volume consistently hits 95-100% on the VU meters  
- **Scaling Algorithm**: Multi-tier algorithm that provides realistic VU meter response
- **Dynamic Range**: Quiet sounds (0.01-0.05 raw) scale to 3-21%, moderate sounds (0.05-0.15 raw) scale to 21-60%

### Device Name Customization

After the first run, the plugin creates an INI configuration file where you can customize device names:

**Location:** `C:\ProgramData\InfoPanel\plugins\InfoPanel.AudioMeter\InfoPanel.AudioMeter.dll.ini`

**Example:**
```ini
[DeviceNames]
{device-guid-1} = Studio Monitors
{device-guid-2} = Gaming Headset  
{device-guid-3} = Streaming Audio
```

Restart InfoPanel to apply custom names.

The plugin automatically detects all available audio output devices and provides real-time monitoring for each device independently. When you change your default audio device in Windows, the "Default Audio Meter" container will automatically switch to monitor the new device with zero configuration required.

## Development

### Building from Source

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/F3NN3X/InfoPanel.AudioMeter.git
cd InfoPanel.AudioMeter

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build the project
dotnet build -c Release

# Output will be in InfoPanel.AudioMeter/bin/Release/net8.0/
```

### Testing

Use the InfoPanel Plugin Simulator for isolated testing:

```powershell
dotnet run --project InfoPanel.Plugins.Simulator/InfoPanel.Plugins.Simulator.csproj
```

## Technical Details

### Multi-Device Audio Processing

- **API Integration**: Direct Windows Core Audio API via P/Invoke and CoCreateInstance
- **COM Interfaces**: `IMMDeviceEnumerator`, `IMMDeviceCollection`, `IMMDevice`, `IAudioMeterInformation`
- **Device Discovery**: Enumeration of all active audio render endpoints with error handling
- **Device Management**: Device caching with COM object lifecycle management
- **Memory Safety**: Proper disposal patterns and safe COM marshaling to prevent memory leaks
- **Default Device Tracking**: Monitoring that follows Windows default device changes
- **Channel Processing**: Averaging of left/right peak values for mono output per device
- **VU Meter Algorithms**: 
  - **Decay**: `Math.Max(peakValue, currentValue * 0.85f)` for realistic falloff behavior
  - **Responsive Scaling**: Multi-tier curves that make music hit 95-100% consistently
- **Error Recovery**: Exception handling for COM marshaling failures and audio system issues

### Device Container Structure

Each audio device gets its own container with:
- **Device Information**: Friendly names, device names, and unique device identification
- **Audio Level Sensor**: Real-time level monitoring with responsive scaling (0-100%)
- **Independent VU Meter State**: Each device maintains its own decay values and scaling algorithms
- **Device Tracking**: Automatic detection of device changes, additions, and removals
- **COM Integration**: Proper device object caching with safe disposal patterns

### Logging Integration

- **Serilog**: Structured logging with class-specific loggers
- **Device Events**: Logs device initialization, errors, and lifecycle events
- **Performance**: Debug-level logging for audio level updates

### Plugin Architecture

Inherits from `InfoPanel.Plugins.BasePlugin` with the following lifecycle:

```csharp
Initialize() → Load(containers) → UpdateAsync() loop → Close()
```

## Configuration

No configuration required - the plugin automatically detects and monitors your default audio output device.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Plugin not loading:**
- Ensure InfoPanel.Plugins framework is available
- Check that PluginInfo.ini is present alongside the DLL
- Verify .NET 8.0 runtime is installed

**No audio data:**
- Confirm default audio device is set correctly in Windows Sound settings
- Check Windows audio permissions and ensure InfoPanel has audio access
- Ensure audio is actually playing and the device is active
- Verify Windows Core Audio API is available (Windows Vista+)

**Performance issues:**
- Plugin uses minimal CPU with 50ms update intervals
- Device caching reduces COM overhead
- Audio device disposal happens automatically on plugin shutdown
- Direct Windows API integration provides reliable performance

**VU meter scaling issues:**
- The plugin uses scaling curves designed for realistic music response
- Music at 100% volume should consistently hit 95-100% on the meters
- If levels seem low, ensure Windows volume levels are properly set
- The scaling is optimized for typical music content (not pure sine waves)

**Device name customization:**
- Edit the INI file in the plugin directory to customize device names
- Restart InfoPanel after making changes to apply new names
- Delete the INI file to reset to default device names
